# 🏀 Marlboro Rec Basketball Lineup Generator

This project builds the **most effective lineups** for a 6-segment game in Marlboro Rec Basketball using pure math and logic.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Ask how many players you have (8 or 9).
- Rank your players from strongest to weakest.
- Automatically calculates and generates the most optimal lineups for all 6 segments.
- Outputs rotations designed for **maximum impact** and **team success**.

## 🧠 Why It Works

Basketball success isn't just about feel or instinct. This generator uses math to make sure your best players are used effectively and your substitutes are placed in the right spots throughout the game.

## 📦 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Run the script in a terminal (Python 3.x required):

```bash
python lineup_generator.py
```

## 🎉 Credits

I would like to give a big thanks to my father (who coaches in the summer) for giving me this idea, and my brother (and teammate) for helping me do the math behind creating these effective lineups.

This was made for the [Marlboro Basketball Association](https://www.marlborobasketball.com/) Recreational League, in order for coaches to build effective lineups while following all play-time rules.
